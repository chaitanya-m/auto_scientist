        Initializes a SubGraphNode with a pre-loaded Keras model and builds a bypass model.

        We need a bypass model because the saved subgraph model comes with its own predefined Input layer, 
        which is set up for receiving raw data in isolation. When you integrate that saved model as a subgraph 
        (or hidden node) into a larger, composed graph, you don't want to use its original Input layer â€” you want 
        to feed it the activations coming from the previous layers of the new model. By creating a bypass model, 
        we replace the original Input layer with a new one that matches the expected shape (excluding the batch 
        dimension) but is part of the new overall graph. This allows the subgraph to operate seamlessly as a 
        hidden component of the larger model while preserving its internal architecture and learned weights.
